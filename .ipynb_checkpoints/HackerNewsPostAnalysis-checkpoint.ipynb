    "This [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) can be culled from over 300,000 posts down to posts which only include posts with comments. Within these posts, there are two main categories: 'Ask HN' and 'Show HN', where users either ask the community for advice, or show the community something they have done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare the two types of posts, 'Ask HN' and 'Show HN', to determine which type gets more comments on average, and to examine whether posts get more comments based on the time they were posted."

Overall, it seems the average amount of votes and comments at these times are fairly close to the same amount, meaning users are voting and commenting about the same amount for posts overall. This also shows the highest amount of activity within the Hacker News community of users posting, voting, and commenting is in the afternoon into the evening. Likely towards the end of the work day."
